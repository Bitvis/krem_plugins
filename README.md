##Installation

###Latest version
To get the krem_plugins version compatible with the latest KREM, please clone the default branch _stable_.

###Older versions
Always clone a branch which is named after the KREM version you are using. For instance, if your KREM version is tagged v2.3.0_stable, then clone krem_plugins from branch krem_v2.3.x_compatible. 

###Where to clone

We recommend to clone directly into _\<your_krem\ project\>/library/plugins_

Copy the file _krem\_plugins/setup.py_ into _\<your\ krem\ project\>/library_ and uncomment the plugins you want to use

See _\<krem installation\>/docs/KREM\_USER\_MANUAL.md_ for guide to setup plugins in your project.
